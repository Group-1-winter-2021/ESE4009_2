programming languages: Embedded c , c++
Operating systems: Linux
software tools: Eclipse ide, xilinx,octave.
Embedded systems engineering design course,has 4 terms in which the firts three terms had the basics and theoritical concepts of subjects like
In term 1: principles of digital logic design, principles of embedded programing, principles of electronics system design which these courses help to build some basics for next term and introduced to board for development,I.e; BeagleBone Black
In term 2: Embedded sytems Architecture and embedded operating systems and Digital signal processing in which learn to start the embedded c coding and use of some tools like octave in DSP
 In term 3 : Embedded Architecture2 and Real time operating system and Embedded systems communication sceurity and protocal in this term got so much of technical concepts from RTos and used LPC1769 board for some experience and in 3014 course introduced to many security communications like i2c,spc,UArt,CAN and us e of gps module and arduino board

So the term 4 is about designing an embedded project from the courses what we have learnt and applying the previous course knowledge for solution to get from a real world solutions.
